# SERVUS: A Self-Evolving Residual Value Unification System

Abstract: “Servus” a latin origination word meaning “at your service” or related to the word we know as “service” in today terms. Servus will be the new action of helping or doing work for someone or a system through interoperability intelligence on the blockchain. A borderless self-evolving collaborative ecosystem would allow digital value assets to be exchanged, created, or shared through a purely decentralized platform. Imagine a world where companies do not have a static function or model but a unified system of residual value being created infinitely at scale. A shift in hierarchical model structures towards a multidimensional structure paradigm will allow core focus specialization in one area while simultaneously cooperating with other systems or organizations in another. We propose a distributed contractual systems model of services where there is no team leader; everyone is equal by cooperating and adapting as one organism. A collaborative filtering recommendation engine and rank model algorithm will facilitate the emergence of quantifiable value while concurrently breaking down systematic barriers through a distributed consensus protocol to stabilize the equilibrium of control without relying on trust.
